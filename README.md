firefox-homepage-generator
--------------------

Tool to generate a dynamic version of a firefox "homepage" with tag cloud of
bookmarks and a backlog.

Idea so far:

 - Have tags from bookmarks form some sort of dynamic (very much js) tag cloud,
   which should be easy to navigate and find stuff in without redirects or much lag.

 - Have a short list of random items from "backlog" - either picked from
   bookmarks by tag or from external sources - to click on and read when bored
   or feel like learning something useful (ha ha).

 - Optional page tabs with a full list of both things.

Work in progress, not really usable yet.
